## Context Section
1. "Here’s how it works: before your trip we agree on a weather threshold—usually a number of rainy days above Tenerife’s summer average. If actual rainfall crosses that line, a pre-set cash compensation lands in your account."
2. "Rain data comes straight from AEMET, Spain’s official meteorological service. That keeps the trigger objective and transparent, so you always know exactly why and when Pluvia pays out."
